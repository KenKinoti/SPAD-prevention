- Or uninstall/reinstall app to re-trigger permission request

**3. "Build failed - Android SDK"**
```bash
# Accept Android licenses
flutter doctor --android-licenses
# Update Android SDK tools in Android Studio
```

**4. "No connected devices"**
```bash
# Check connected devices
flutter devices
# Restart ADB if needed
adb kill-server
adb start-server
```

**5. "Gradle build failed"**
```bash
# Clean build
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

**6. "TensorFlow Lite errors"**
- This is expected - app uses simulation mode for demo
- Real TensorFlow Lite integration would require trained model

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ green_signals/     # Green signal samples
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ yellow_signals/    # Yellow signal samples
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ no_signals/        # Background/negative samples
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dataset_info.csv   # Export manifest for training
```

**How to Collect Training Data:**
1. Open the app and navigate to camera screen
2. Tap the blue **"TRAINING"** button
3. Select signal type (Red/Green/Yellow/None)
4. Point camera at target signal or background
5. Add optional description
6. Tap **"CAPTURE"** to save training image
7. Repeat for diverse conditions and angles

### ü§ñ **ML Model Integration Architecture**

**Current Implementation:**
- **MLSignalDetector** service with TensorFlow Lite integration
- Automatic fallback to color-based detection when no model is available
- Camera frame preprocessing and model inference pipeline
- Confidence scoring and signal classification

**Training Data Requirements:**
- **Minimum**: 50+ images per category for basic training
- **Recommended**: 200+ images per category for robust performance
- **Diversity**: Different lighting, angles, distances, weather conditions

### üîÑ **ML Integration Steps**

**Phase 1: Data Collection (Current)**
```bash
# Use the training screen to collect samples
1. Point camera at red signals ‚Üí Capture 100+ samples
2. Point camera at green signals ‚Üí Capture 100+ samples
3. Point camera at yellow signals ‚Üí Capture 100+ samples
4. Point camera at backgrounds ‚Üí Capture 100+ samples
```

**Phase 2: Model Training (External)**
```python
# Example training pipeline (external to app)
1. Export training data from device
2. Create TensorFlow model using collected images
3. Train CNN for signal classification
4. Convert to TensorFlow Lite format (.tflite)
5. Optimize for mobile deployment
```

**Phase 3: Model Deployment**
```dart
1. Place trained model in assets/models/signal_classifier.tflite
2. App automatically switches from color-based to ML detection
3. MLSignalDetector handles inference and classification
4. Fallback remains available if model fails
```

- **Distance Accuracy**: Estimation assumes standard signal dimensions
- **ML Accuracy**: Simulation mode - real models will have error rates

### Safety Guidelines
- **Never rely solely** on this app for safety decisions
- **Always follow** established railway safety protocols
- **Regular calibration** would be required for production use
- **Redundant systems** needed for actual safety applications

### Risk Factors
- **False Positives**: May trigger unnecessary alarms
- **False Negatives**: Could miss actual red signals (catastrophic)
- **Weather Dependencies**: Reduced accuracy in adverse conditions
- **Mounting Stability**: Camera angle affects detection accuracy

## Performance Optimization

### Current Optimizations
- Frame processing limited to prevent overload
- Detection history capped at 1000 entries
- Efficient image processing pipeline
- Background processing for ML inference

### Production Considerations
- **Model Optimization**: Quantized TensorFlow Lite models
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Use NPU/GPU when available
- **Power Management**: Optimize for battery life
- **Thermal Management**: Prevent device overheating

## Development Notes

### Adding Features
1. **Update Models**: Modify `detection_result.dart` for new data types
2. **Implement Service**: Add logic in appropriate service file
3. **Update UI**: Modify screens to display new features
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify functionality across devices

### Testing Strategy

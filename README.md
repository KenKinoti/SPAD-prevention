flutter doctor -v
# Add Flutter to PATH if needed
```

**2. "Camera permission denied"**
- In AVD: Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí RailSafe SPAD POC ‚Üí Permissions ‚Üí Camera ‚Üí Allow
- Or uninstall/reinstall app to re-trigger permission request

**3. "Build failed - Android SDK"**
```bash
# Accept Android licenses
flutter doctor --android-licenses
# Update Android SDK tools in Android Studio
```

**4. "No connected devices"**
```bash
# Check connected devices
flutter devices
# Restart ADB if needed
adb kill-server
adb start-server
```

**5. "Gradle build failed"**
```bash
# Clean build
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

**6. "TensorFlow Lite errors"**
- This is expected - app uses simulation mode for demo
- Real TensorFlow Lite integration would require trained model

#### Performance Tips

- **Emulator**: Enable hardware acceleration for better camera performance
- **Physical Device**: Use real Android device for accurate camera testing
- **Memory**: Close other apps while testing

## Configuration

Key parameters in the application:

- **Critical Distance**: 100m (red signal alert threshold)
- **Standard Signal Height**: 30cm (for distance calculation)
- **Detection Confidence**: Variable (displayed as percentage)
- **Alert Duration**: Continuous until signal changes
- **History Limit**: 1000 detections maximum

## Machine Learning Integration

### Current Implementation
The app currently uses **simulation mode** for demonstration:
- Generates random signal detections every 3-10 seconds
- Simulates red/green/yellow signal classifications
- Calculates distance based on simulated bounding box size
- Provides realistic confidence scores

### Real ML Integration Steps
To integrate actual machine learning:

1. **Train a Model**: Create TensorFlow Lite model for railway signal detection
2. **Model Requirements**:
   - Input: Camera frame (RGB image)
   - Output: Object detection with classification
   - Classes: Red, Green, Yellow signals
   - Format: TensorFlow Lite (.tflite)

3. **Replace Simulation**: Update `SignalDetector._simulateMLInference()` with:
   ```dart
   // Load TensorFlow Lite model
   final interpreter = await Interpreter.fromAsset('signal_detection_model.tflite');

   // Run inference on camera frame
   interpreter.run(inputImage, output);

   // Parse results and return DetectionResult
   ```

4. **Bundle Model**: Add `.tflite` file to `assets/` directory

## Hardware Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **Android Device**: API level 21+ (Android 5.0)
- **RAM**: 4GB for smooth operation
- **Storage**: 100MB app size
- **Camera**: Rear camera with autofocus
- **Processor**: ARM64 or x86_64 architecture

### Recommended Specifications
- **Modern Android**: API 33+ (Android 13+)
- **High-Performance CPU**: Snapdragon 8xx series or equivalent
- **Good Camera**: OIS, good low-light performance
- **Mounting**: Sturdy vehicle mount for hands-free operation

## Safety Considerations & Limitations

### Critical Limitations
- **Single Point of Failure**: Relies on one camera and device
- **Environmental Sensitivity**: Performance degrades in fog, rain, direct sunlight
- **Distance Accuracy**: Estimation assumes standard signal dimensions
- **ML Accuracy**: Simulation mode - real models will have error rates

### Safety Guidelines
- **Never rely solely** on this app for safety decisions
- **Always follow** established railway safety protocols
- **Regular calibration** would be required for production use
- **Redundant systems** needed for actual safety applications

### Risk Factors
- **False Positives**: May trigger unnecessary alarms
- **False Negatives**: Could miss actual red signals (catastrophic)
- **Weather Dependencies**: Reduced accuracy in adverse conditions
- **Mounting Stability**: Camera angle affects detection accuracy

## Performance Optimization

### Current Optimizations
- Frame processing limited to prevent overload
- Detection history capped at 1000 entries
- Efficient image processing pipeline
- Background processing for ML inference

### Production Considerations
- **Model Optimization**: Quantized TensorFlow Lite models
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Use NPU/GPU when available
- **Power Management**: Optimize for battery life
- **Thermal Management**: Prevent device overheating

## Development Notes

### Adding Features
1. **Update Models**: Modify `detection_result.dart` for new data types
2. **Implement Service**: Add logic in appropriate service file
3. **Update UI**: Modify screens to display new features
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify functionality across devices

### Testing Strategy
```bash
# Unit tests
flutter test

# Integration tests
flutter test integration_test/

# Performance profiling
flutter run --profile
```
